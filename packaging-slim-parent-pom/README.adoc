= Jenkinsfile Runner Packaging POM - Slim Edition (Experimental)
:toc:
:toc-placement: preamble
:toclevels: 3

This is an experimental parent POM for packaging custom Jenkinsfile Runner images.
It targets slim packaging when Jenkinsfile Runner loads the WAR file and the plugins from external location.

The parent POM prepares the following artifacts in `target`:

* `jenkinsfile-runner.zip` Slim Jenkinsfile Runner bundle ZIP (~1.5MB).
  This archive needs to be unzipped, there is an executable in `bin/jenkinsfile-runner`
* `war/jenkins.war` - Jenkins WAR file, based on the `jenkins.version` property.
  This file needs to be unzipped for consumption in the `-w` option.
* `plugins` - List of plugins based on the declared dependencies.
  Parent POM automatically includes the minimum dependencies declared in plugin POM.

== Usage in Docker

See link:../packaging/docker/unix/eclipse-temurin-17-jre/Dockerfile-dev-slim[Dockerfile-dev-slim] for example.
This example also uses additional optimization tricks.

== Status

The packaging tool is under active development,
and it may be changed in incompatible way.
